# filename_translate

This is a simple program that was made using Python. The rename_files function takes the path of the files you'd like to rename/translate as an argument.

Future upgrades could include:

* Passing optional arguments to rename_files such as:
	* Whether there is a table that can be used as a character reference for translating.
	* If there are any characters that need to be deleted. 
* Checking if the working directory is the same as the file(s) directory.
